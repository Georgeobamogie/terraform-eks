# terraform-eks

In this configuration, the terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws module is used to create an EKS cluster, while the terraform-providers/kubernetes/helm module is used to install and configure the Kubernetes provider. The helm.sh/nginx-ingress-controller module is used to deploy the Nginx ingress controller, which allows incoming traffic into the cluster. The my_app_module is a custom module that contains the application's Helm chart and other resources required for deployment. Finally, the kubernetes_manifest resource is used to apply the manifests generated by the my_app_module to the cluster. The output of the kubeconfig provides access to the cluster's Kubernetes API.
